Problem Statement           (Asked in Accenture Offcampus 2 Aug 2021, Slot 3)

You are required to implement the following function:

Int Calculate(int m, int n);

The function accepts 2 positive integer ‘m’ and ‘n’ as its arguments.You are required to calculate the sum of numbers divisible both by 3 and 5, between ‘m’ and ‘n’ both inclusive and return the same.
Note
0 < m <= n

Example

Input:
m : 12
n : 50

Output
90

Explanation:
The numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, between 12 and 50 both inclusive are {15, 30, 45} and their sum is 90.
Sample Input
m : 100
n : 160
Sample Output
510

#include <stdio.h>

int Calculate(int m, int n){
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = m; i <= n; i++){
        if(i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0){
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}


int main()
{
	int m, n, result;

    printf ("Enter the value of m : ");
    scanf ("%d", &m);

    printf ("Enter the value of n : ");
    scanf ("%d", &n);

    result = Calculate (m, n);
    printf ("%d", result);

	return 0;
}
